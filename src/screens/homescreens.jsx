            Galle Fort, located in the southern coast of Sri Lanka, is a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site renowned for its historical significance,
            architectural beauty, and cultural charm. Originally built by the
            Portuguese in the 16th century, it was later fortified by the Dutch
            during the 17th century, reflecting a blend of European
            architectural styles.This fortified city served as a strategic hub
            for trade and defense, witnessing centuries of colonial influence
            and maritime commerce. Today, Galle Fort stands as a living
            testament to Sri Lanka's colonial past, with its well-preserved
            ramparts, cobblestone streets, and colonial-era buildings.
