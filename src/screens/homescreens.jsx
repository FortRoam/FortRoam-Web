              Galle Fort, located in the southern coast of Sri Lanka, is a UNESCO
              World Heritage Site renowned for its historical significance,
              architectural beauty, and cultural charm. Originally built by the
              Portuguese in the 16th century, it was later fortified by the Dutch
              during the 17th century, reflecting a blend of European
              architectural styles.This fortified city served as a strategic hub
              for trade and defense, witnessing centuries of colonial influence
              and maritime commerce. Today, Galle Fort stands as a living
              testament to Sri Lanka's colonial past, with its well-preserved
              ramparts, cobblestone streets, and colonial-era buildings.
